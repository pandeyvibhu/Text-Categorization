# Text-Categorization

Today, loads of stuffs are available as digital information, hence it is need of the hour to have an optimal document classification system. An efficient classification would provide us information in an organized way and save analysis time. The state of the art categorization system are quite brittle, they traditionally represent documents to be classified as bag of words, BOW approach accounts for term frequency in the document and ignores the important semantic relation between the documents. Authors have adopted various strategies to improve upon these approach, like using information from Word-net. Achieved improvement was very limited in this model because of reasons like large training data, sole dependency on document to be classified and above all, losing semantic relationship. Our model addresses these problems in an elegant way by extracting related information from encyclopedia knowledge (Wikipedia is used as a tool for external knowledge) and focusing on key-phrases rather than words. Experimental results on several test data have showed an improved and more obvious results than the baseline algorithm our enhanced model provides all relevant categories in order of their importance (weighs).
